# Applying-User-Authentication-and-Access-Controls

## Objective
In this lab, I will use the Active Directory Users and Computers utility to create several new users and groups. I will then create a folder structure that aligns with the new groups and assign permissions that restrict user access to each folder based on group membership. Finally, I will verify authentication and access controls by logging in as each user and attempting to access each folder.

### Skills Learned
- Understand how Microsoftâ€™s Active Directory Domain Services can be used to implement an authentication and access control framework.
- Create new user accounts and security groups in a Windows environment.

- Create access control lists to protect objects and folders from unauthorized access in a Windows environment.
- Distinguish Windows Security permissions from Windows Share permissions.
- Configure access controls for a remote file server using Active Directory Security Groups.

### Tools and Software Used
- Active Directory Users and Computers
- PowerShell
- TrueNAS
